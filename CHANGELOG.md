# Changelog

All notable changes to Soulbound are recorded here. The format is based on
Keep a Changelog (https://keepachangelog.com), and the project aims to follow
semantic versioning.

Version stamps appear in every commit subject as `v0.X.N`, so the history reads
as a sequence of small, individually described changes rather than a few large
ones.

## 0.0 (2026-07-26)

The first version. Turns an unmodified Create Your Frisk v0.6.6 LTS 3 snapshot
into a clean, documented base to build a game on. No gameplay is implemented.

### Added

- A documentation set of 46 Markdown pages under `docs/`, converted by hand from
  the 644 KB Bootstrap website that Create Your Frisk shipped. It covers the
  whole engine: text commands, game events, every Lua object, projectiles,
  pixel-perfect collision, sprites and animation, shaders, and the overworld,
  plus the key, item, and dialog bubble references. Content is preserved; only
  the presentation changed.
- Three project pages written for this repository:
  [repository layout](docs/project/repository-layout.md),
  [building](docs/project/building.md), and
  [engine architecture](docs/project/engine-architecture.md).
- `Assets/Mods/Soulbound/`, the mod folder the game will live in, scaffolded with
  the standard Create Your Frisk layout and a placeholder encounter, monster, and
  wave. Without at least one mod containing a non-`@` encounter script, the mod
  selector stops with "Your mod folder is empty!", so the placeholder exists to
  keep the engine bootable. The placeholder monster draws the `empty` sprite from
  `Assets/Default/Sprites`, so the mod ships no art of its own.
- A `tools/` directory for build and content tooling.
- Community documents: a contributing guide, a code of conduct, a security
  policy, a support page, and project terms.

### Changed

- The Unity project moved from `engine/` to the repository root. This restored
  the root-relative paths that `.gitignore` and `.github/workflows/build.yml`
  already assumed.
- `Build.py` and the CI workflow now copy `docs/` into builds, in place of the
  removed website folder.
- `README.md` and the bug report template were rewritten for this project rather
  than the upstream engine.
- `actions/checkout` moved from v2 to v5, which runs on Node 24.
- `game-ci/unity-builder` moved from v2 to v4. The v2 action used a legacy
  licensing module that depended on an activation file flow GameCI has since
  deprecated, which left it with no working way to activate a licence. This was
  the change that got CI building.

### Removed

- Roughly 37 MB of upstream example content: the six example mods
  (`@0.5.0_SEE_CRATE`, `@OverWorld Test`, `Examples`, `Examples 2`, `RTLGeno`,
  `Encounter Skeleton`), eleven demo overworld scenes, the demo Tiled2Unity map
  data, and the demo map prefabs. The Tiled2Unity importer itself was kept, since
  it is needed to author maps.
- `Assets/Scripts/Tests`, six scripts with no scene or code references.
  `Assets/Scripts/Why` was kept: `DogGyrator.cs` is used by `Error.unity` and
  `Temmify.cs` by five engine files.
- The Bootstrap documentation website and the GitHub Pages workflow that
  published it.
- The upstream Discord notification workflows, which targeted the Create Your
  Frisk Discord and could not work here.
- The Unity activation workflow. Its core action was deprecated upstream and now
  fails on purpose; licences are obtained locally through Unity Hub instead. See
  [docs/project/building.md](docs/project/building.md).

### Fixed

- Four places in the engine named the removed demo content directly and were
  repaired: the scene list in `ProjectSettings/EditorBuildSettings.asset`,
  `AddKeysToMapCorrespondanceList()` in `Assets/Scripts/Util/UnitaleUtil.cs`, and
  the hardcoded `FirstLevelToLoad` and `ModFolder` values in
  `Main Camera OW.prefab`, `Canvas OW.prefab`, and `Background 1.prefab`.

### Notes

- The repository dropped from 3841 to 2311 tracked files, and from about 101 MB
  to 65 MB.
- Scenes are loaded by name from C#, never by build index, which is what made
  removing the demo maps safe. Twelve engine scenes remain.
- The overworld has no first map yet, so `FirstLevelToLoad` is empty on both
  overworld prefabs. `TransitionOverworld` guards this with
  `FileLoader.SceneExists()` and shows a readable error, so it degrades cleanly
  until a map exists.
- CI builds Windows, macOS, and Linux successfully, which is the first
  confirmation that the cleanup compiles.
